Welcome to the team NULL WRO github.
This github contains all the resources, schamatics and code required to replictae our efforts for the 7th iteration in our "Chihuahua" series of vehicles entered into the Future Engineers Catagory.

The file "Engineering Journal" contains the documentaion of our efforts, step-by-step assembly instructions and links to other sections of the github as you need it. It is generally a good place to start. 

Have fun and happy robot-ing
